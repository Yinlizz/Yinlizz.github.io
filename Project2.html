                            The idea of the game is the following scenario: The game character finds himself in some kind of ancient ruin and is stuck there.
                            After a small adventure, the player finds a locked exit, but to open it, the player needs to find several different objects related to the ruin.
                            Some objects the player can find directly by exploring the ruins, while some are locked behind a puzzle.
                            The player may also discover that he is not completely alone...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game is implemented with the Unity game engine.
                            The game is single-player and contains a small-scale narrative, however leaving much of it up to the player to figure out for themselves.
                            The player's perspective is in the first person, trying to create a claustrophobic immersion.
                            The goal is to create a short but intense game experience that makes the player "use their brain" and that would be remembered after playing.
                            The game is also likely to be published on Itch.io.
