                        <p>
                            During the course, we were tasked to create a game prototype of our choosing in Unity as a solo project.
                            I choose to make a side scrolling platformer game inspired by the old school classics like Super Mario, Sonic and Mega Man.
                            As the project was a course assignment, it is not available for public.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Game consists of one level that requires the player to reach the goal to win the game.
                            Player has three hitpoints indicated by the healthbar on the upper-left corner.
                            Level consists of platforms, obstacles and patrolling enemies. Player can't harm them, they will only take damage from them.
                            To help the player reach the goal, they can find health pickups to restore health and one checkpoint incase of player death.

                        <p>
                            I was the sole developer on this project and I'm responsible for the gameplay.
                            All the visual and audio assets are from Unity asset store and not made by me.
                            Point of the assignment was not to make a proper and finished game, but to make something playable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the time was used to research Unity usage and programming for it.
                            Thankfully Unity has a big community that has created a lot of tutorials and documentation for different aspects that are clear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For me the most impressive thing in this project is the way the camera acts and moves.
                            Game draws a gizmo box around the player character and when character touches the box, depending from where, it moves with the player and camera moves too, tracking the gizmo.
                            As such, it creates the same kind of effect as in old school platformers, where the camera follows the player.
                            Gizmo is also fully customizable in Unity and you see it visually.
                            Code for this effect is shown below. â†“

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            The project was an excellent introduction to Unity and 2D games.
                            I learned a lot about using Unity and how to program functions in it for 2D game.
                            In such a short amount of time, I was able to make a nice prototype of a sidescrolling platforming game and I'm definitely planning to evolve this to an actual game at some point in the future.
                            In future I want to make my own assets for such a game and add more levels and functionality.
                            As such, it was an excellent assignment and it already took me so much forward on this journey.
                            It will help me a lot on future projects concerning Unity and 2D space.
